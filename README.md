# ðŸŒŸ O'Reilly Advancing into Analytics
Focus area: Data analysis using Python.

Period: Jun 2023

At the end of the book and project, these are my ðŸ”‘ key learnings:

- Learn the data analysis process of exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python, using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Stats, and Matplotlib.
- Apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as conducting A/B statistical hypothesis testing and building supervised machine learning models, such as linear regression.
- Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data and use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
- Apply visualization principles to the data analysis process and explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## ðŸŒ¤ [Project: Weight and Mileage of Cars]([url](https://github.com/annechenginc/O-Reilly-Python-for-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Weight%20and%20Mileage%20of%20Cars.ipynb))
In this data analysis, I use hypothesis testing to analyze car data and compare the relationship of weight of the car to it's manufacturing origin, and I train a linear regression machine learning model.
